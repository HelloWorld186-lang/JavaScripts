        //sync
        //blocking code //block the flow of code //example read file sync //means read file first then code is gone to run again 
        //async
        //non blocking code //does not block the excution of the code //example read file async //means read file  then parallely and other code is continue gone to run. 

        //see the img  screenshot //the async function are settimeout , setitervael and fetch (in them fetch is priority queue) //wen the function is excute they working as  queue => first come first excute //but fetch use the prority queue //means fectch come first as compare to other
