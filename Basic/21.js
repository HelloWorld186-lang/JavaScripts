    1.global ec 
    2. function ec
    3.eval ec 

    where code is gone to run :- then firstly global object is gone to form , then after memory and excution phase is gone to run 
    //in memory phase //only assign of the value to the variable 
    //in excution //only excution part of the code is gone to calcuate 

    //note when function is gone to call then , new varibale enivroment (same as memory phase) and excution thread (same as excution pahase ) is gone to run 

    //note when function call inside the function then there is the stack of the functions call (push and pool of the function is same as the stack working (lifo concept))
